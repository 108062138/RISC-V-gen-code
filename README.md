# RISC-V-gen-code
> by popo
## abstract
- This project is about the third project in LJK-NTHU-COMPILER class. Its main purpose targetes to generate RISC-V code based on the parser, which was implemented by the second project.
## how to run this project
- type `chmod 777 run.sh` to enable the the shell script in the current working directory
- type `./run.sh` to run the project. See the `./run.sh`'s content to realize work it executes. The first line `make` compiles the revised parser. Next, dump the testbench `./test.c` into the parser's binary executable file. It produces `./codegen.S`. `./codegen.S` is the assembly code generated by the parser. It interacts with `./main.c` to simulate the arduino board.
```javascript=
make
./parser < test.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o sample_prog main.c codegen.S
spike pk sample_prog
```
## support function
- Up to level C. That is, basic, arithmetic, pointer
  - basic: support `delay()` and `digitalWrite(int argv1,int argv2)`
    - These function has ABCD part. Their behavior is depitcted at `./parser.y`. I'm going to explain them one by one. 
    - C(caller calls the function)...
    - A(for the callee, enter the function body)...
    - B(for the callee, exit the function body)...
    - D(for the caller, receive the return value)... 
  - arithmetic: support `+-*/=()`...
  - pointer: single level pointer   
    - The symbol table is intended to tackle pointer. It is implemeted at `./symbolTable.c`
